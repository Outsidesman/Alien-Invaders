alien_invasion is a clone of space invaders in python. Each level increases in speed and awards the player with more points per enemy ship downed. Colliding with enemy ships results in losing a life.
Run ```python3 alien_invasion.py``` to start the game.

sideways_shooter is a 'boss level' where the player must hit the boss to continue. Missing the boss results in one lost life.
Unlike alien_invasion, the game is rotated 90 degrees (for more practice coding the gameplay elements).
Run ```python3 sideways_shooter.py``` to start the game.
